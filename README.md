    <h1>📦 C++ Management Systems Repository</h1>

  <h2>📝 Summary</h2>
    <p>This repository contains different C++ projects centered around simple management systems. Each project is stored in a dedicated branch to isolate functionality, codebase, and evolution. The two main systems so far are:</p>

  <p><strong>1. Login/Register System</strong>: A basic terminal-based authentication system allowing users to create accounts with unique usernames and securely log in. Data persistence is achieved through text files (<code>data.txt</code>), and input validation ensures account integrity. This project showcases fundamental file I/O and string handling in C++.</p>

  <p><strong>2. Library Management System</strong>: A more advanced system using object-oriented programming and STL containers. It includes book and user management, borrowing/returning workflows, request queues, and robust file-based data persistence (<code>books.txt</code> and <code>users.txt</code>). It demonstrates modular class design and clean menu-based interaction.</p>

  <h2>🌿 Repository Structure</h2>
p>
      Each branch in this repository represents a separate project to keep codebases modular and organized. For example, one branch holds the login/register system, while another holds the library system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving forward, I plan to expand this repository by “dumping” or developing any type of management-related systems—such as inventory, student tracking, scheduling apps, and more—within isolated branches for clarity and scalability.
